This directory contains sample data categorized into five classes for training and testing the deep learning model. Each folder represents a distinct class:

1. **other_activities**:
   - Data: Sample images depicting drivers engaged in various non-driving activities that may lead to distraction.

2. **texting_phone**:
   - Data: Images capturing drivers using a phone to text while driving, a significant distraction.
